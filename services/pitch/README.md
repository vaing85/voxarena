# VoxArena — Pitch service

Real pitch detection (librosa **PYIN**, CPU-only) and pitch-accuracy scoring.
This is the **Layer A** scoring engine from [ARCHITECTURE](../../docs/ARCHITECTURE.md);
the Node API stays the score authority and is the intended caller.

## Run

```bash
cd services/pitch
python3 -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt        # runtime + test deps
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000  # dev server
pytest -q                                  # tests (synthetic audio)
```

> `soundfile` needs the system `libsndfile` library (preinstalled on most Linux/macOS; the Dockerfile installs `libsndfile1`).

## API

### `GET /health`
`{ "ok": true, "service": "voxarena-pitch" }`

### `POST /analyze` (multipart)
| field | type | notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| `audio` | file | WAV (mono or stereo; stereo is averaged to mono) |
| `reference` | string | JSON array of notes: `[{ "start": 0.0, "end": 1.5, "midi": 69 }]` (seconds + MIDI note) |

Response:
```json
{
  "sampleRate": 22050,
  "durationSec": 1.5,
  "scorePitch": 98.3,        // 0–100, or null if nothing to evaluate
  "evaluatedFrames": 120,    // voiced frames that had a target note
  "voicedFrames": 124,
  "totalFrames": 130,
  "voicedRatio": 0.954,
  "meanCentsError": 7.8      // mean absolute cents off target, or null
}
```

A frame is a **hit** when the sung pitch is within `cents_tolerance` (default 100
cents = one semitone) of the target note. `scorePitch` is the hit fraction.

## How it fits

```
client mic ──audio──▶ Node API (/performances) ──audio+reference──▶ pitch service ──scorePitch──▶ Node stores score
```

**Not wired yet (follow-ups):**
- Audio capture in the client and upload to the Node API.
- Per-song **reference pitch** (notes/MIDI) storage — `Song.referenceId` exists but holds no note data yet.
- Node calling this service (behind `PITCH_SERVICE_URL`) to replace the stub pitch layer.

Only Layer A (pitch) is implemented here; timing/stability/dynamics/transitions remain heuristic in the Node scorer.
